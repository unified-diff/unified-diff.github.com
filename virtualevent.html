        <h2>Virtual Unified Diff</h2>

        <p>At #udiff number 7 <a href="https://twitter.com/hamishharvey">@hamishharvey</a> secretly
        used some of his Arduino based cameras to snap timelapse photos of the entire event.  So below
        you should see on the left the camera at the front of the room, and on the right the camera
        at the back (should be roughly in sync).</p>

        <div id="photostream"></div>

        <script type="text/javascript" src="/js/photostream.js"></script>

        <p>Thanks to Hamish for supplying the photos, sorry it took us so long to get them online!</p>
