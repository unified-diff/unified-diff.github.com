        <p>For too long, Cardiff's software development community has been
        fragmented by language, discipline, and platform.</p>

        <p><span class="unified">unified</span>.<span class="diff">diff</span> is a
        monthly meet-up for anybody involved or interested in the field of software
        development.</p>

        <p>We hold tech talks, and trade war stories.</p>

        <h2>first event success</h2>
        <p>We had a great turnout for the first event.  All talks were received very well, massive
        thanks to the speakers and to everyone who made the trip to attend.</p>

        <p>We've got three more great speakers lined up for next month.  Same place, Wednesday 7th
        March.  Hope to see you all there!</p>
