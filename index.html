            <p>A massive thanks to the speakers and everyone who came to May's event at Fire Island!  We had
            some technical 'teething issues' with the venue, but it's something we'll have sorted for June.
            If you have any feedback and suggestions please let us know.</p>

            <p>Also, if you'd like to speak at a future Unified Diff, or have some free time that you could
            spare to helping organise an event then please get in touch with us.  You can reach us on Twitter,
            on IRC, or via the mailing list - all linked in the top right of the page.</p>

            <p>See you in June!</p>
