# Unified Diff

Source code for the Unified Diff website.

## Hacking

The site is built with Jekyll, and deployed via Github Pages.  You can install
Jekyll by running...

<pre>
gem install jekyll
</pre>

Then after cloning the repo, change to the folder and start the Jekyll server...

<pre>
jekyll --server
</pre>

Jekyll is now running and you should be able to navigate to the following URL to view the website...

<pre>
http://0.0.0.0:4000
</pre>

When you make changes to files these will automatically be updated, so it's nice and easy to develop.  _But_ you will need to restart Jekyll when you add new files.
