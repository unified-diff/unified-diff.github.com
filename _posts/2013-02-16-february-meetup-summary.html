<h2>Feburary Meetup</h2>

<p>As always a massive thanks to everyone who came along to the February meetup, we hope
you had as much fun as we did.  Quick intro to the format of this blog post, we're hoping
that we'll add at least a monthly writeup with a few more details than we usually include
in the short summary on the homepage.  This will be the task of the compere, whomever that
may be (if you fancy getting involved and stepping up for this role one month please get in
touch we'd love to hear from you!)</p>

<p>So without further ado...</p>

<h3>Emulate this!</h3>

<p>First up this month was <a href="https://twitter.com/DougGore">@DougCore</a>, back for
his second Unified Diff talk (a veritable veteran).  Previously Doug had spoke about
the <a href="/videos/doug-gore-raspberry-pi.html">Raspberry Pi</a> and this time his topic was
again quite low level - how to write your own emulator.</p>

<p>@TODO SCREENSHOT</p>

<p>Doug started off by giving a great overview of what an emulator is, along with the different approaches
towards how you accomplish emulation with the challenges, trade-offs and benefits of each.</p>

<h3>High Quality Code</h3>

<p>Next up was resident Unified Diff soundman and workhorse of an organiser <a href="http://twitter.com/gavd_uk">@GavD_UK</a>.
This slot was originally planned to be taken by <a href="http://twitter.com/niftydigits">@niftydigits</a> but
he had to step down at the last minute, but luckily Gav was able to step up.</p>
