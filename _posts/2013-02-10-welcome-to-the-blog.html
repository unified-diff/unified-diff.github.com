<h2>Welcome to the Blog</h2>

<p>We're always looking for more ways to get as many people as possible
involved and contributing to Unified Diff, it's main purpose is to get
everyone active and involved in the scene.  People should feel like this
is <b>their</b> meetup, not just something they attend.</p>

<p>So as a new outlet we've decided to start a blog!</p>

<h3>Contributing</h3>

If you'd like to write something on the blog then you'll need to first fork the repository,
add your post, and then <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">open a pull request</a>.

<p>Blog posts need to be stored in the <i>_posts</i> directory, and are
simply HTML files.  Take a look at the source of this post to see an example.
You should be able to easily include source code snippets like this...</p>

{% highlight php %}
class Hello {
    public function bar() {
        // etc...
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>And any other styling you need, add it to the CSS.  If you have any problems
then you can tweet us, jump on IRC, or post to the mailing list.</p>

<p>We look forward to reading your work!</p>
